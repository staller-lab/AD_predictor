O15516	O15516	CLOCK_HUMAN	CLOCK BHLHE8 KIAA0334	Homo sapiens (Human)	Circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput (hCLOCK) (EC 2.3.1.48) (Class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 8) (bHLHe8)	FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Regulates the circadian expression of ICAM1, VCAM1, CCL2, THPO and MPL and also acts as an enhancer of the transactivation potential of NF-kappaB. Plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer regulates the circadian expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, VWF, B3, CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1, PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2, F7, NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and also genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism. Promotes rhythmic chromatin opening, regulating the DNA accessibility of other transcription factors. The CLOCK-BMAL2 heterodimer activates the transcription of SERPINE1/PAI1 and BHLHE40/DEC1. The preferred binding motif for the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer is 5'-CACGTGA-3', which contains a flanking Ala residue in addition to the canonical 6-nucleotide E-box sequence (PubMed:23229515). CLOCK specifically binds to the half-site 5'-CAC-3', while BMAL1 binds to the half-site 5'-GTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer also recognizes the non-canonical E-box motifs 5'-AACGTGA-3' and 5'-CATGTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). CLOCK has an intrinsic acetyltransferase activity, which enables circadian chromatin remodeling by acetylating histones and nonhistone proteins, including its own partner BMAL1. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) via the acetylation of multiple lysine residues located in its hinge region (PubMed:21980503). The acetyltransferase activity of CLOCK is as important as its transcription activity in circadian control. Acetylates metabolic enzymes IMPDH2 and NDUFA9 in a circadian manner. Facilitated by BMAL1, rhythmically interacts and acetylates argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) leading to enzymatic inhibition of ASS1 as well as the circadian oscillation of arginine biosynthesis and subsequent ureagenesis (PubMed:28985504). Drives the circadian rhythm of blood pressure through transcriptional activation of ATP1B1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18587630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21659603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21980503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22284746, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23229515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23785138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24005054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28985504}.

O43151	O43151	TET3_HUMAN	TET3 KIAA0401	Homo sapiens (Human)	Methylcytosine dioxygenase TET3 (EC 1.14.11.n2)	FUNCTION: Dioxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of the modified genomic base 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and plays a key role in epigenetic chromatin reprogramming in the zygote following fertilization (PubMed:31928709). Also mediates subsequent conversion of 5hmC into 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and conversion of 5fC to 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Conversion of 5mC into 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC probably constitutes the first step in cytosine demethylation (By similarity). Selectively binds to the promoter region of target genes and contributes to regulate the expression of numerous developmental genes (PubMed:23217707). In zygotes, DNA demethylation occurs selectively in the paternal pronucleus before the first cell division, while the adjacent maternal pronucleus and certain paternally-imprinted loci are protected from this process. Participates in DNA demethylation in the paternal pronucleus by mediating conversion of 5mC into 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC. Does not mediate DNA demethylation of maternal pronucleus because of the presence of DPPA3/PGC7 on maternal chromatin that prevents TET3-binding to chromatin (By similarity). In addition to its role in DNA demethylation, also involved in the recruitment of the O-GlcNAc transferase OGT to CpG-rich transcription start sites of active genes, thereby promoting histone H2B GlcNAcylation by OGT (PubMed:23353889).

Acts as an anchor for a PKA-signaling complex onto mitotic chromosomes, which is required for maintenance of chromosomes in a condensed form throughout mitosis. Recruits condensin complex subunit NCAPD2 to chromosomes required for chromatin condensation; the function appears to be independent from PKA-anchoring (PubMed:10601332, PubMed:10791967, PubMed:11964380).

May be involved in recruitment of active CASP3 to the nucleus in apoptotic cells (PubMed:16227597). May act as a carrier protein of GJA1 for its transport to the nucleus (PubMed:26880274). May play a repressive role in the regulation of rDNA transcription. Preferentially binds GC-rich DNA in vitro. In cells, associates with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) chromatin, preferentially with rRNA promoter and transcribed regions (PubMed:26683827). Involved in modulation of Toll-like receptor signaling. Required for the cAMP-dependent suppression of TNF-alpha in early stages of LPS-induced macrophage activation; the function probably implicates targeting of PKA to NFKB1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q63014, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9DBR0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10601332, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10791967, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11964380, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16980585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22130794, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26683827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26880274, ECO:0000305|PubMed:14641107, ECO:0000305|PubMed:9473338}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:9840937, PubMed:24652652). One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

P10276	P10276	RARA_HUMAN	RARA NR1B1	Homo sapiens (Human)	Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-alpha) (Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group B member 1)	FUNCTION: Receptor for retinoic acid (PubMed:19850744, PubMed:16417524, PubMed:20215566). Retinoic acid receptors bind as heterodimers to their target response elements in response to their ligands, all-trans or 9-cis retinoic acid, and regulate gene expression in various biological processes (PubMed:28167758). The RXR/RAR heterodimers bind to the retinoic acid response elements (RARE) composed of tandem 5'-AGGTCA-3' sites known as DR1-DR5 (PubMed:28167758, PubMed:19398580). In the absence of ligand, the RXR-RAR heterodimers associate with a multiprotein complex containing transcription corepressors that induce histone deacetylation, chromatin condensation and transcriptional suppression (PubMed:16417524). On ligand binding, the corepressors dissociate from the receptors and associate with the coactivators leading to transcriptional activation (PubMed:9267036, PubMed:19850744, PubMed:20215566). Formation of a complex with histone deacetylases might lead to inhibition of RARE DNA element binding and to transcriptional repression (PubMed:28167758). Transcriptional activation and RARE DNA element binding might be supported by the transcription factor KLF2 (PubMed:28167758). RARA plays an essential role in the regulation of retinoic acid-induced germ cell development during spermatogenesis (By similarity). Has a role in the survival of early spermatocytes at the beginning prophase of meiosis (By similarity). In Sertoli cells, may promote the survival and development of early meiotic prophase spermatocytes (By similarity).

Stimulates p53/TP53-dependent transcription through enhanced recruitment of EP300 leading to increased acetylation of p53/TP53 (PubMed:15509808, PubMed:18084608). Plays an important role in immune response directly affecting NK maturation and activity, macrophage production of IL12, Th1 development and maturation of CD8+ T-cells (PubMed:11244049, PubMed:11846971, PubMed:11846974, PubMed:16932750).

P15918	P15918	RAG1_HUMAN	RAG1 RNF74	Homo sapiens (Human)	V(D)J recombination-activating protein 1 (RAG-1) (RING finger protein 74) [Includes: Endonuclease RAG1 (EC 3.1.-.-); E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RAG1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase RAG1)]	FUNCTION: Catalytic component of the RAG complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates the DNA cleavage phase during V(D)J recombination. V(D)J recombination assembles a diverse repertoire of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes in developing B and T-lymphocytes through rearrangement of different V (variable), in some cases D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments. In the RAG complex, RAG1 mediates the DNA-binding to the conserved recombination signal sequences (RSS) and catalyzes the DNA cleavage activities by introducing a double-strand break between the RSS and the adjacent coding segment. RAG2 is not a catalytic component but is required for all known catalytic activities. DNA cleavage occurs in 2 steps: a first nick is introduced in the top strand immediately upstream of the heptamer, generating a 3'-hydroxyl group that can attack the phosphodiester bond on the opposite strand in a direct transesterification reaction, thereby creating 4 DNA ends: 2 hairpin coding ends and 2 blunt, 5'-phosphorylated ends. The chromatin structure plays an essential role in the V(D)J recombination reactions and the presence of histone H3 trimethylated at 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3) stimulates both the nicking and haipinning steps. The RAG complex also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. The introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele induces ATM-dependent repositioning of the other allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. In addition to its endonuclease activity, RAG1 also acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates monoubiquitination of histone H3. Histone H3 monoubiquitination is required for the joining step of V(D)J recombination. Mediates polyubiquitination of KPNA1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

Specifically recognizes and binds E-box sequences (5'-CANNTG-3'); efficient DNA-binding requires dimerization with itself or with another MiT/TFE family member such as TFEB or MITF (By similarity). Involved in the cellular response to amino acid availability by acting downstream of MTOR: in the presence of nutrients, TFE3 phosphorylation by MTOR promotes its cytosolic retention and subsequent inactivation (PubMed:31672913). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of MTOR induces TFE3 dephosphorylation, resulting in nuclear localization and transcription factor activity (PubMed:31672913). Maintains the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells by promoting the expression of genes such as ESRRB; mTOR-dependent TFE3 cytosolic retention and inactivation promotes exit from pluripotency (By similarity). Required to maintain the naive pluripotent state of hematopoietic stem cell; mTOR-dependent cytoplasmic retention of TFE3 promotes the exit of hematopoietic stem cell from pluripotency (PubMed:30733432). TFE3 activity is also involved in the inhibition of neuronal progenitor differentiation (By similarity). Acts as a positive regulator of browning of adipose tissue by promoting expression of target genes; mTOR-dependent phosphorylation promotes cytoplasmic retention of TFE3 and inhibits browning of adipose tissue (By similarity). In association with TFEB, activates the expression of CD40L in T-cells, thereby playing a role in T-cell-dependent antibody responses in activated CD4(+) T-cells and thymus-dependent humoral immunity (By similarity). Specifically recognizes the MUE3 box, a subset of E-boxes, present in the immunoglobulin enhancer (PubMed:2338243). It also binds very well to a USF/MLTF site (PubMed:2338243).

P19838	P19838	NFKB1_HUMAN	NFKB1	Homo sapiens (Human)	Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p105 subunit (DNA-binding factor KBF1) (EBP-1) (Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1) [Cleaved into: Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p50 subunit]	FUNCTION: NF-kappa-B is a pleiotropic transcription factor present in almost all cell types and is the endpoint of a series of signal transduction events that are initiated by a vast array of stimuli related to many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52 and the heterodimeric p65-p50 complex appears to be most abundant one. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. NF-kappa-B heterodimeric p65-p50 and RelB-p50 complexes are transcriptional activators. The NF-kappa-B p50-p50 homodimer is a transcriptional repressor, but can act as a transcriptional activator when associated with BCL3. NFKB1 appears to have dual functions such as cytoplasmic retention of attached NF-kappa-B proteins by p105 and generation of p50 by a cotranslational processing. The proteasome-mediated process ensures the production of both p50 and p105 and preserves their independent function, although processing of NFKB1/p105 also appears to occur post-translationally. p50 binds to the kappa-B consensus sequence 5'-GGRNNYYCC-3', located in the enhancer region of genes involved in immune response and acute phase reactions. In a complex with MAP3K8, NFKB1/p105 represses MAP3K8-induced MAPK signaling; active MAP3K8 is released by proteasome-dependent degradation of NFKB1/p105. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15485931}.

Q00653	Q00653	NFKB2_HUMAN	NFKB2 LYT10	Homo sapiens (Human)	Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p100 subunit (DNA-binding factor KBF2) (H2TF1) (Lymphocyte translocation chromosome 10 protein) (Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 2) (Oncogene Lyt-10) (Lyt10) [Cleaved into: Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p52 subunit]	FUNCTION: NF-kappa-B is a pleiotropic transcription factor present in almost all cell types and is the endpoint of a series of signal transduction events that are initiated by a vast array of stimuli related to many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. In a non-canonical activation pathway, the MAP3K14-activated CHUK/IKKA homodimer phosphorylates NFKB2/p100 associated with RelB, inducing its proteolytic processing to NFKB2/p52 and the formation of NF-kappa-B RelB-p52 complexes. The NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RelB-p52 complex is a transcriptional activator. The NF-kappa-B p52-p52 homodimer is a transcriptional repressor. NFKB2 appears to have dual functions such as cytoplasmic retention of attached NF-kappa-B proteins by p100 and generation of p52 by a cotranslational processing. The proteasome-mediated process ensures the production of both p52 and p100 and preserves their independent function. p52 binds to the kappa-B consensus sequence 5'-GGRNNYYCC-3', located in the enhancer region of genes involved in immune response and acute phase reactions. p52 and p100 are respectively the minor and major form; the processing of p100 being relatively poor. Isoform p49 is a subunit of the NF-kappa-B protein complex, which stimulates the HIV enhancer in synergy with p65. In concert with RELB, regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:7925301}.

Thought to recognize the sugar-phosphate structure of double-stranded DNA. Transcriptional repressor controlling nuclear and viral gene expression in a phosphorylated and acetylated status-dependent manner, by binding to matrix attachment regions (MARs) of DNA and inducing a local chromatin-loop remodeling. Acts as a docking site for several chromatin remodeling enzymes (e.g. PML at the MHC-I locus) and also by recruiting corepressors (HDACs) or coactivators (HATs) directly to promoters and enhancers. Modulates genes that are essential in the maturation of the immune T-cell CD8SP from thymocytes. Required for the switching of fetal globin species, and beta- and gamma-globin genes regulation during erythroid differentiation. Plays a role in chromatin organization and nuclear architecture during apoptosis. Interacts with the unique region (UR) of cytomegalovirus (CMV). Alu-like motifs and SATB1-binding sites provide a unique chromatin context which seems preferentially targeted by the HIV-1 integration machinery. Moreover, HIV-1 Tat may overcome SATB1-mediated repression of IL2 and IL2RA (interleukin) in T-cells by binding to the same domain than HDAC1.

Restricts the expression of neuronal genes by associating with two distinct corepressors, SIN3A and RCOR1, which in turn recruit histone deacetylase to the promoters of REST-regulated genes (PubMed:10449787, PubMed:10734093). Mediates repression by recruiting the BHC complex at RE1/NRSE sites which acts by deacetylating and demethylating specific sites on histones, thereby acting as a chromatin modifier (By similarity). Transcriptional repression by REST-CDYL via the recruitment of histone methyltransferase EHMT2 may be important in transformation suppression (PubMed:19061646).

Also maintains repression of neuronal genes in neural stem cells, and allows transcription and differentiation into neurons by dissociation from RE1/NRSE sites of target genes (By similarity). Thereby is involved in maintaining the quiescent state of adult neural stem cells and preventing premature differentiation into mature neurons (PubMed:21258371). Plays a role in the developmental switch in synaptic NMDA receptor composition during postnatal development, by repressing GRIN2B expression and thereby altering NMDA receptor properties from containing primarily GRIN2B to primarily GRIN2A subunits (By similarity).

May negatively regulate the repressor activity of isoform 1 by binding to isoform 1, thereby preventing its binding to NRSE and leading to derepression of target genes (PubMed:11779185). However, in another study, does not appear to be implicated in repressor activity of a NRSE motif-containing reporter construct nor in inhibitory activity on the isoform 1 transcriptional repressor activity (PubMed:11741002).

Constitutes a precursor of the transcription factor NRF1 (By similarity). Able to detect various cellular stresses, such as cholesterol excess, oxidative stress or proteasome inhibition (PubMed:20932482). In response to stress, it is released from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane following cleavage by the protease DDI2 and translocates into the nucleus to form the transcription factor NRF1 (By similarity). Acts as a key sensor of cholesterol excess: in excess cholesterol conditions, the endoplasmic reticulum membrane form of the protein directly binds cholesterol via its CRAC motif, preventing cleavage and release of the transcription factor NRF1, thereby allowing expression of genes promoting cholesterol removal, such as CD36 (By similarity). Involved in proteasome homeostasis: in response to proteasome inhibition, it is released from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, translocates to the nucleus and activates expression of genes encoding proteasome subunits (PubMed:20932482). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q61985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20932482, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24448410}.; FUNCTION: [Transcription factor NRF1]: CNC-type bZIP family transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus and regulates expression of target genes in response to various stresses (PubMed:8932385, PubMed:9421508). Heterodimerizes with small-Maf proteins (MAFF, MAFG or MAFK) and binds DNA motifs including the antioxidant response elements (AREs), which regulate expression of genes involved in oxidative stress response (PubMed:8932385, PubMed:9421508). Activates or represses expression of target genes, depending on the context (PubMed:8932385, PubMed:9421508). Plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis by acting as a sensor of cholesterol excess: in low cholesterol conditions, translocates into the nucleus and represses expression of genes involved in defense against cholesterol excess, such as CD36 (By similarity). In excess cholesterol conditions, the endoplasmic reticulum membrane form of the protein directly binds cholesterol via its CRAC motif, preventing cleavage and release of the transcription factor NRF1, thereby allowing expression of genes promoting cholesterol removal (By similarity). Critical for redox balance in response to oxidative stress: acts by binding the AREs motifs on promoters and mediating activation of oxidative stress response genes, such as GCLC, GCLM, GSS, MT1 and MT2 (By similarity). Plays an essential role during fetal liver hematopoiesis: probably has a protective function against oxidative stress and is involved in lipid homeostasis in the liver (By similarity). Involved in proteasome homeostasis: in response to proteasome inhibition, mediates the 'bounce-back' of proteasome subunits by translocating into the nucleus and activating expression of genes encoding proteasome subunits (PubMed:20932482). Also involved in regulating glucose flux (By similarity). Together with CEBPB; represses expression of DSPP during odontoblast differentiation (PubMed:15308669).

Regulates the transcription of type I IFN genes (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) by binding to an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) in their promoters (PubMed:11846977, PubMed:16846591, PubMed:16979567, PubMed:20049431, PubMed:32972995). Acts as a more potent activator of the IFN-beta (IFNB) gene than the IFN-alpha (IFNA) gene and plays a critical role in both the early and late phases of the IFNA/B gene induction (PubMed:16846591, PubMed:16979567, PubMed:20049431). Found in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells and following viral infection, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), or toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, is phosphorylated by IKBKE and TBK1 kinases (PubMed:22394562, PubMed:25636800, PubMed:27302953). This induces a conformational change, leading to its dimerization and nuclear localization and association with CREB binding protein (CREBBP) to form dsRNA-activated factor 1 (DRAF1), a complex which activates the transcription of the type I IFN and ISG genes (PubMed:16154084, PubMed:27302953, PubMed:33440148).

Plays a key role in the differentiation of T-helper 1 cells and the production of interferon-gamma (PubMed:12213961, PubMed:35614130). Participates also in multiple neutrophil functions including chemotaxis and production of the neutrophil extracellular traps (By similarity). After IL12 binding to its receptor IL12RB2, STAT4 interacts with the intracellular domain of IL12RB2 and becomes tyrosine phosphorylated (PubMed:7638186, PubMed:10415122). Phosphorylated STAT4 then homodimerizes and migrates to the nucleus where it can recognize STAT target sequences present in IL12 responsive genes. Although IL12 appears to be the predominant activating signal, STAT4 can also be phosphorylated and activated in response to IFN-gamma stimulation via JAK1 and TYK2 and in response to different interleukins including IL23, IL2 and IL35 (PubMed:11114383,PubMed:34508746). Transcription activation of IFN-gamma gene is mediated by interaction with JUN that forms a complex that efficiently interacts with the AP-1-related sequence of the IFN-gamma promoter (By similarity).

H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression by recruiting HP1 (CBX1, CBX3 and/or CBX5) proteins to methylated histones. Mainly functions in euchromatin regions, thereby playing a central role in the silencing of euchromatic genes. H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation is coordinated with DNA methylation (PubMed:12869583). Required for HUSH-mediated heterochromatin formation and gene silencing. Forms a complex with MBD1 and ATF7IP that represses transcription and couples DNA methylation and histone 'Lys-9' trimethylation (PubMed:27732843, PubMed:14536086). Its activity is dependent on MBD1 and is heritably maintained through DNA replication by being recruited by CAF-1 (PubMed:14536086,). SETDB1 is targeted to histone H3 by TRIM28/TIF1B, a factor recruited by KRAB zinc-finger proteins. Probably forms a corepressor complex required for activated KRAS-mediated promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) or other tumor-related genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306).

In addition to its telomeric DNA-binding role, required to recruit a number of factors and enzymes required for telomere protection, including the shelterin complex, TERF2IP/RAP1 and DCLRE1B/Apollo. Component of the shelterin complex (telosome) that is involved in the regulation of telomere length and protection. Shelterin associates with arrays of double-stranded 5'-TTAGGG-3' repeats added by telomerase and protects chromosome ends; without its protective activity, telomeres are no longer hidden from the DNA damage surveillance and chromosome ends are inappropriately processed by DNA repair pathways. Together with DCLRE1B/Apollo, plays a key role in telomeric loop (T loop) formation by generating 3' single-stranded overhang at the leading end telomeres: T loops have been proposed to protect chromosome ends from degradation and repair.

In normal conditions, ubiquitinated and degraded in the cytoplasm by the BCR(KEAP1) complex (PubMed:11035812, PubMed:15601839, PubMed:29018201). In response to oxidative stress, electrophile metabolites inhibit activity of the BCR(KEAP1) complex, promoting nuclear accumulation of NFE2L2/NRF2, heterodimerization with one of the small Maf proteins and binding to ARE elements of cytoprotective target genes (PubMed:19489739, PubMed:29590092). The NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway is also activated in response to selective autophagy: autophagy promotes interaction between KEAP1 and SQSTM1/p62 and subsequent inactivation of the BCR(KEAP1) complex, leading to NFE2L2/NRF2 nuclear accumulation and expression of cytoprotective genes (PubMed:20452972). May also be involved in the transcriptional activation of genes of the beta-globin cluster by mediating enhancer activity of hypersensitive site 2 of the beta-globin locus control region (PubMed:7937919). Also plays an important role in the regulation of the innate immune response and antiviral cytosolic DNA sensing. It is a critical regulator of the innate immune response and survival during sepsis by maintaining redox homeostasis and restraint of the dysregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways like MyD88-dependent and -independent and TNF-alpha signaling (By similarity). Suppresses macrophage inflammatory response by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription and the induction of IL6 (By similarity). Binds to the proximity of pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages and inhibits RNA Pol II recruitment. The inhibition is independent of the NRF2-binding motif and reactive oxygen species level (By similarity). Represses antiviral cytosolic DNA sensing by suppressing the expression of the adapter protein STING1 and decreasing responsiveness to STING1 agonists while increasing susceptibility to infection with DNA viruses (PubMed:30158636). Once activated, limits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection and to virus-derived ligands through a mechanism that involves inhibition of IRF3 dimerization. Also inhibits both SARS-CoV-2 replication, as well as the replication of several other pathogenic viruses including Herpes Simplex Virus-1 and-2, Vaccinia virus, and Zika virus through a type I interferon (IFN)-independent mechanism (PubMed:33009401). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60795, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11035812, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15601839, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19489739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20452972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29018201, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29590092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30158636, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31398338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33009401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7937919}.

Also mediates subsequent conversion of 5hmC into 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and conversion of 5fC to 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (PubMed:21778364). In addition to its role in DNA demethylation, plays a more general role in chromatin regulation by recruiting histone modifying protein complexes to alter histone marks and chromatin accessibility, leading to both activation and repression of gene expression (PubMed:33833093). Plays therefore a role in many biological processes and diseases, including stem cell maintenance, T and B-cell development, inflammation regulation, genomic imprinting, neural activity or DNA repair (PubMed:31278917). Involved in the balance between pluripotency and lineage commitment of cells it plays a role in embryonic stem cells maintenance and inner cell mass cell specification. Plays an important role in the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells. TET1-mediated production of 5hmC acts as a recruitment signal for the CHTOP-methylosome complex to selective sites on the chromosome, where it methylates H4R3 and activates the transcription of genes involved in glioblastomagenesis (PubMed:25284789). Binds preferentially to DNA containing cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) dinucleotides over CpH (H=A, T, and C), hemimethylated-CpG and hemimethylated-hydroxymethyl-CpG (PubMed:29276034).

Belongs to the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells.

Regulates the transcriptional networks during embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation (By similarity). Promotes recruitment of the PRC2 complex to the inactive X chromosome in differentiating XX ES cells and PRC2 recruitment to target genes in undifferentiated ES cells (By similarity). Required to repress Hox genes by enhancing H3K27me3 methylation of the PRC2 complex (By similarity). In some conditions may act as an inhibitor of PRC2 activity: able to activate the CDKN2A gene and promote cellular senescence by suppressing the catalytic activity of the PRC2 complex locally (By similarity). Binds to the metal-regulating-element (MRE) of MT1A gene promoter (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q02395, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23142980, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23228662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31959557}.
